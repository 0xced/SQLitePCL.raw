    /// <summary>
    ///
    /// This interface provides core functionality of the SQLite3 API.  It is the
    /// boundary between the portable class library and the platform-specific code
    /// below.
    ///
    /// In general, it is defined to be as low-level as possible while still remaninig
    /// "portable".  For example, a sqlite3 connection handle appears here as an IntPtr.
    /// Same goes for the C-level sqlite3_stmt pointer, also an IntPtr.
    ///
    /// However, this layer does deal in C# strings, not the utf8 pointers that the
    /// SQLite C API uses.  This is because the code to marshal the utf8 pointers
    /// to/from C# strings is not "portable".  It would require referencing assemblies
    /// here that we do not want to reference.  We prefer to keep the PCL itself clean
    /// and accept a little extra mess in the platform assemblies.
    ///
    /// This whole library is designed in 4 layers:
    ///
    /// (1)  The SQLite C API itself
    ///
    /// (2)  The declarations of the C API.  This is either pinvoke or C++ COM glue,
    ///      depending on the platform.
    ///
    /// (3)  A C# layer in the platform assembly which implements this interface.  This
    ///      includes converting strings to/from utf8.  It also needs to be a non-static
    ///      class, which layer (2) is not.
    ///
    /// (4)  The raw API, here in the PCL, which wraps an instance of this interface in
    ///      an API which replaces all the IntPtrs with strong typed (but still opaque) 
    ///      counterparts.
    ///
    /// Even the top layer is still very low-level, which is why it is called "raw".
    /// This API is not intended to be used by app developers.  Rather it is designed
    /// to be a portable foundation for higher-level SQLite APIs.
    ///
    /// The philosophy of this library is to remain as similar to the underlying
    /// SQLite API as possible, even to the point of keeping the sqlite3_style_names
    /// and style.  It is expected that higher-level APIs built on this wrapper
    /// would present an API which is friendlier to C# developers.
    ///
    /// </summary>

missing test for sqlite3_exec with a hook.
it would probably crash, since the implementation
doesn't gc protect the delegate?  or is this one
a special case because the delegate only lives
as long as the call?

deal with stdcall/winsqlite3 in Setup

need to setup some x86 stdcall builds for testing?
or just use winsqlite3 itself.  irritating that 
the test suite passes using winsqlite3 and either 
calling convention.  why?

DI for the utf8 stuff?  #202

debug vs release builds?

more xunit test cases

goal is to have no ifdefs in core

chgs to intptr dispose?  #166  SafeHandle

chg to SourceGear name?

instead of delegate-ish types in raw.cs should the functions

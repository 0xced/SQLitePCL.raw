distinction between win-arm and win8-arm ?

just one lib pkg each for e_sqlite3
and sqlcipher

what nuspec does dotnet pack generate?

what are the empty dep groups for?

maybe don't do bundle_winsqlite3?

chg cb build scripts to use VS 2017

fix cb paths

rename sqlcipher to e_sqlcipher

test on uwp

restore those win32 set directory calls somewhere

default load, so the setup call can be optional
in many or most cases

stuff in csproj so we can do dotnet pack?
probably not.

AssemblyInfo stuff, version numbers

lib and bundle packages

preload from arch directory stuff.  subdirectory
by cpu arch.

--

missing test for sqlite3_exec with a hook.
it would probably crash, since the implementation
doesn't gc protect the delegate?  or is this one
a special case because the delegate only lives
as long as the call?

deal with stdcall/winsqlite3 in Setup

need to setup some x86 stdcall builds for testing?
or just use winsqlite3 itself.  irritating that 
the test suite passes using winsqlite3 and either 
calling convention.  why?

DI for the utf8 stuff?  #202

debug vs release builds?

more xunit test cases

goal is to have no ifdefs in core

chgs to intptr dispose?  #166  SafeHandle

version of gen_build which only does the nugets
for packaging e_sqlite and sqlcipher builds

chg to SourceGear name?

instead of delegate-ish types in raw.cs should the functions
take something like Func<whatever> ?

can the hook_info classes be simplified?

the cppinterop projects need the same thing the sqlite3 projects
got:  separate vcxproj for each platform, sharing as much of the
msbuild stuff as possible among them.

update/fix the nuget stuff

do we need separate platform assemblies for Windows 8.1 vs 8.0 ?

do we need separate platform assemblies for .NET 4.5 vs 4.5.1 ?

do we need separate platform assemblies for older versions of .NET,
like 4.0 ?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.

consider reorganizing the Ext directories into a hierarchy.
so many of them, and more to come.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  
maybe if we organize the Ext dirs into a hierarchy, put the test
projects adjacent

add tests that use actual named sqlite database files, not just
:memory: and temp dbs.

should reference NUnit as a nuget package

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.

consider removing the reflection-based platform resolver.
maybe we should just require the following line to do the
dependency injection on every platform.  it's required on Xamarin
anyway:

    SQLitePCL.Platform.Instance = new SQLitePCL.SQLite3Provider();

in the csproj files, consider use of Choose/When to have conditional 
references and such.  or conditional profile 78/158/etc.  would
such a thing be compatible with xbuild/XamarinStudio?

special build for desktop Mono?  or does net45 cover that?

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

separate build of iOS version with a bundled SQLite __Internal ?
would need to build sqlite3 for iOS so we can embed it in the resource
for __Internal.  MonoDevelop Makefile integration?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

question about whether we are statically linking the C library
or not, for the mixed mode assembly.

building static lib for sqlite3 when what we really need is the
dll, for winrt/pinvoke and for desktop/pinvoke anyway.

remove the VS gallery sqlite references

Xamarin.Android, pinvoke my_sqlite3, with sqlite3 lib in resource

i hate the way all the tests show up in visual studio, 5 tests with
the same name, no way to distinguish between the platform versions
of each test.

fix those weird compiler warnings on iOS and Android ?

sqlcipher?

note that SQLitePCL.Ugly only builds with the "new" reflection APIs.

looks like profile 259 is the new 78

document cases where we have code that is shared by different platform
assemblies

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

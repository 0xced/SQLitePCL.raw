why doesn't the cppinterop.dll get copied to the pcl build
output for winmd stuff?

for the cppinterop dll build, why does winrt80 generate .exp
and .lib?

Win32 in the sln file

gen nuspec

gen msbuild that invokes all the others?

auto-generate the tests as well?

update/fix the nuget stuff

write the .props and .targets part of the nuget package

maybe ugly should be a nuget package of its own

some of those solution platform configurations could go away?

rm xamarin projects from visual studio SLN so that msbuild will work

do we need separate platform assemblies for .NET 4.5 vs 4.5.1 ?

do we need separate platform assemblies for older versions of .NET,
like 4.0 ?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  

add tests that use actual named sqlite database files, not just
:memory: and temp dbs.

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.
should reference NUnit as a nuget package

special build for desktop Mono?  or does net45 cover that?

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

separate build of iOS version with a bundled SQLite __Internal ?
would need to build sqlite3 for iOS so we can embed it in the resource
for __Internal.  MonoDevelop Makefile integration?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

question about whether we are statically linking the C library
or not, for the mixed mode assembly.

for the windows pinvoke projects, we need to be building sqlite3 native dlls

Xamarin.Android, pinvoke my_sqlite3, with sqlite3 lib in resource

i hate the way all the tests show up in visual studio, 5 tests with
the same name, no way to distinguish between the platform versions
of each test.

fix those weird compiler warnings on iOS and Android ?

sqlcipher?

note that SQLitePCL.Ugly only builds with the "new" reflection APIs.

looks like profile 259 is the new 78

hmmm.  note that one axis of configuration we are not varying is
the compile options for sqlite itself.  we always build with FTS
and with ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA, and nothing else

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

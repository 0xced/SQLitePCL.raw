
maybe try using the dummy csproj approach to
pack the nuspecs?

version stuff could now be separated out of
gen_nuspecs into its own gen thing

pack.bat and push.bat should go away with build.bat

default vim mode for F# sucks

get rid of bat and chg to something cross-platform

gen_nuspec should write the same EOL convention
on all platforms

.editorconfig

review EntryPoint attribute

dotnet-format.  but won't work for provider.tt.

should the other batteries also build on a placeholder
instead of the actual ios lib assembly?  allows
dotnet cli instead of desktop msbuild.

restore those win32 set directory calls somewhere.
but we don't want ifdef down in raw or provider.
maybe in batteries?

investigate using NativeLibrary class on
.NET Core 3.  and maybe implement the native
lib stuff for other runtimes as a compatible
subset of the same api?

want a way to force the tests at the end of
build.bat to use the nupkgs just built, not the
ones in the nuget cache.  previous workaround
was to force a timestamp into the pkg name, but
that's sad.

provider.dynamic should probably check File.Exists
(on things that are an absolute path) before trying
LoadLibrary/dlopen.

zetetic dynamic needs to look in dirs named x86/x64, 
not rids.  for compat with their existing package.
chg Setup.Load() to check the x86 and x64 dirs?
or create a special Load call for that case?

clean.bat

finish impl of batteries for the net461 case,
like the previous preload from arch dir.

with an SDK-style net461 project, how to control
the cpu target of the build?  msbuild prop Platform?

net461 or net472 ?

I wonder if there are any other ways that v2 breaks 
the existing zetetic package.

investigate console UWP apps with C# for testing.
build 17134.

nuspec should show SQLitePCLRaw org account as
owner?

what should the nuspecs say for min client version?
nuspecs generated by dotnet pack do not have this,
but this was apparently a bug that has been fixed.

DONE: consider default enable_next_stmt() to false

chg release notes in nuspec to reference a URL?
on github?  on my blog?

why is the device xunit runner for UWP crashing?

msbuild props to omit native builds in targets?

concern about dictionary<intptr, T> because it's
a value type?  ios AOT.  ToString() instead?
it would seem that the latest versions of mono
now support this case.

DONE: maybe v2 should use the v141 builds and include arm64

test on uwp, ios, android, net461, mono

nuspec tags.  write them into Directory.Build.props from
gen_nuspecs?

utf8 stuff?  #202
appears to require netcore or net472.  not netstandard.

arguably the device runner tests should move into
test_pkgs

consider build the tests as an assembly instead of always
compiling the file

--

still wish the other nuspecs could reference
Directory.Build.props instead of being
generated with the version string in it.

since we're introducing the e_sqlcipher name,
should we add 3 or 4 to distinguish the
underlying sqlcipher version?

the top half of the provider class is the
same for dynamic vs dllimport.  use a partial
class and share it?

new sn key for lib.e_sqlcipher.  hmmm.
or should we just use the same one as before?
and why do we have the same key for 
the android and ios versions of this?
same goes for e_sqlite3.

--

in general, only one of the following is true:
	win, LoadLibrary, dll suffix
	everything else, dlopen
		macos, dylib suffix
		everything else, so suffix

ios: either system or internal

android: std places
	just load e_sqlite3?

.net core: should find from rid, just
load "e_sqlite3" ?

mono on mac
Xamarin.Mac
mono on linux
.net framework on windows
    subdirs from the targets file

cdecl vs stdcall?

maybe everything which needs a targets file should
also need to pass more info (a path) to Setup

--

add sqlite3_key et al to the pinvoke list?

constructing the string:
	basename
		e_sqlite3
		e_sqlcipher
		sqlite3
		sqlcipher
	add dll/dylib/so suffix
	path
		starting
			cwd
			executingassembly.location
			other?
		subdir
			nothing?
			native/rid (targets)

--

review the weird stuff agg functions do
with the context pointer

later: rename sqlcipher in cb to e_sqlcipher

--

need to setup some x86 stdcall builds for testing?
or just use winsqlite3 itself.  irritating that 
the test suite passes using winsqlite3 and either 
calling convention.  why?

more xunit test cases

goal is to have no ifdefs in core

--

cb/bld

in the readme, explain why iOS lib has static in name.
and why internal.  and why SQLitePCL.lib.embedded.Init()

need the ability to disconnect:
    1.  the env used to compile an assembly
    2.  the lib/env dir in nuget

for bundle_e_sqlite3, we want to build two things for netstandard11:
    1.  e_sqlite3, into netcoreapp
    2.  none, into netstandard11

enable_shared_cache.  is this present?  does akavache need it?

change the targets files
to not do the copy when packages.config is present?

understand runtime.json and rid-specific deps, even
if they are not officially supported

--------

is CopyNuGetImplementations causing trouble?
with project.json : runtimes?

need to go to nuget.org and mark some of the older 
packages deprecated

maybe the "first pinvoke set that works" code should
go somewhere else, higher up?

--------

can we do a dylib ios version?

----

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

should maybe use the value from commit_hook (and rollback_hook) internally
to verify/dispose the hook_handle?

unprotected sqlite3_value:  sqlite3_column_value, sqlite3_bind_value, sqlite3_result_value

sqlite3_get_auxdata

sqlite3_wal_autocheckpoint

sqlite3_busy_handler

sqlite3_collation_needed -- difficult because of the be handle passed
to the callback

Aha!  winrt dyn sqlite3 works if the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Runtime Package
for Windows is added as a reference.

nuget package which has no sqlite libraries in it:
	ios -- system
	android -- system
	winrt -- vs gallery
	wp8 -- vs gallery
	wp81 -- vs gallery?
	net45 -- SOL

nuget package which bundles current sqlite for every plat:
	ios -- __internal, resource (build on mac)
	android -- resource (build somewhere)
	all others -- c++/cx (static?  or dynamic?)

can't get sqlite3.dll for cppinterop_dynamic to work out.
for winrt81, it gets copied to the output directory, but
the test suite won't run, saying it can't find the file.
error message doesn't say sqlite3.dll, but adding a reference
to the WinRT sqlite SDK makes it work.

wp81_rt fails just like winrt81

wp81_sl fails too.

ios: doesn't even build.  injectreference in targets just doesn't
seem to work.

for net45, works fine.

wp80 works too.  sqlite3.dll ends up in the xap.

android: works fine.

should we use the sqlite sdks in the vs gallery instead?
weird that they're not nuget.  and weird that there isn't
one for regular net45.  and the distinction between the two
flavors of WP81 is not there.  and the WP81 is pre-release.

need to error on anycpu

maybe pinvoke versions should install sqlite3.dll?

maybe sqlite3.dll should go in build/native?  
so pinvoke could share it?

why does the sqlitepcl ios platform assembly show
no assembly info when viewed in xamarin studio?

ios nuget.  adds reference to the bait.  not good.
the .targets file doesn't seem to have any effect.

if lib/portable stuff is there, it gets added as a
reference (to the bait), and then the stuff in build/targets
doesn't work.  take out the bait assemblies, and the
build/targets thing works (on winrt anyway).  reference
doesn't show up in references, but the build succeeds,
even as you change the platform in configuration manager.

android
	currently only one platform assembly
	always match?  no condition?
	move to the lib directory?
	anycpu.  no platform condition.

ios
	no platform condition.
	always want the pinvoke_sqlite3 option.
	
net45
	cppinterop_sqlite3_dynamic
	platform matching works: x64 and x86
	anycpu not available

winrt, wp (all of them)
	cppinterop_sqlite3_dynamic
	platform matching works: arm and x86
	anycpu not available

nuget targets match any cpu is busted

how do you get the reference to reset when the platform changes?
or why doesn't the reference properties dialog show the new one?

include the dynamic sqlite3.dll with pinvoke versions?

make the dynamic sqlite3 version work somehow.  copytooutput?

each nuget package should only try to set one reference in any
given situation.

test the nuget targets file with wp8 and other envs.

figure out a way to disable the mac/ios projects while
using msbuild from the command line

delete the old build system

error if configuration is not release or debug

for the cppinterop dll build, why does winrt80 generate .exp
and .lib?

Win32 in the sln file

auto-generate the tests as well?

update/fix the nuget stuff

write the .props and .targets part of the nuget package

maybe ugly should be a nuget package of its own

some of those solution platform configurations could go away?

rm xamarin projects from visual studio SLN so that msbuild will work

do we need separate platform assemblies for .NET 4.5 vs 4.5.1 ?

do we need separate platform assemblies for older versions of .NET,
like 4.0 ?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  

add tests that use actual named sqlite database files, not just
:memory: and temp dbs.

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.
should reference NUnit as a nuget package

special build for desktop Mono?  or does net45 cover that?

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

separate build of iOS version with a bundled SQLite __Internal ?
would need to build sqlite3 for iOS so we can embed it in the resource
for __Internal.  MonoDevelop Makefile integration?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

question about whether we are statically linking the C library
or not, for the mixed mode assembly.

for the windows pinvoke projects, we need to be building sqlite3 native dlls

Xamarin.Android, pinvoke my_sqlite3, with sqlite3 lib in resource

i hate the way all the tests show up in visual studio, 5 tests with
the same name, no way to distinguish between the platform versions
of each test.

fix those weird compiler warnings on iOS and Android ?

sqlcipher?

note that SQLitePCL.Ugly only builds with the "new" reflection APIs.

looks like profile 259 is the new 78

hmmm.  note that one axis of configuration we are not varying is
the compile options for sqlite itself.  we always build with FTS
and with ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA, and nothing else

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

I suppose we could still put in a needy/cppinterop version
for wp80 and wp81_sl into the _needy package.  It doesn't
have to remain pinvoke only.

consider whether maybe the sqlite3 intptr dispose should check
the version number and call sqlite3_close_v2 when it's supposedly
available.

switch to xUnit

we could switch the RT flavor of WP81 to use pinvoke

maybe I should have config_csproj instead of three different
flavors of same.

test needy with the sqlite vsix

sqlite.raw_current:  how to deal with sqlite3 build on ios?

switch my env keywords to be the same as the ones nuget uses?

test_cases.cs nuget, nunit vs mstest

net45 pinvoke targets file should copytooutput only when on windows

add visual studio 2013 c++ runtime sdkreference.  but injecting an
SDKReference in the .targets file sort of doesn't work, and using
a powershell tool is so inelegant.  MESSAGE.

clean up TODOs in new nuspecs

create/generate a csproj which just builds the bait, for use by
praeclarum/timheuer in building sqlite-net with USE_SQLITEPCL_RAW
defined.

annoying that an injected reference doesn't show up in the
References list in visual studio

error if configuration is not release or debug
but configuration in xamarin.ios is actually stuff like iPhone, etc

nuspecs:
	basic
		ios in lib
		android in lib
		all others in build/targets, bundle current
	needy
		ios in lib
		android in lib
		all others in build/targets, bundle nothing
	kitchen_sink
		everything in build
		no references added
		basically just a zip file
	bundle_current
		ios in lib
		android in lib
		all others in build/targets, bundle current

nuget package which has no sqlite libraries in it:
	ios -- system
	android -- system
	winrt -- vs gallery
	wp8 -- vs gallery
	wp81 -- vs gallery?
	net45 -- SOL

nuget package which bundles current sqlite for every plat:
	ios -- __internal, resource (build on mac)
	android -- resource (build somewhere)
	all others -- c++/cx (static?  or dynamic?)

should we use the sqlite sdks in the vs gallery instead?
weird that they're not nuget.  and weird that there isn't
one for regular net45.  and the distinction between the two
flavors of WP81 is not there.  and the WP81 is pre-release.

why does the sqlitepcl ios platform assembly show
no assembly info when viewed in xamarin studio?

android
	currently only one platform assembly
	always match?  no condition?
	move to the lib directory?
	anycpu.  no platform condition.

ios
	no platform condition.
	always want the pinvoke_sqlite3 option.
	
net45
	cppinterop_sqlite3_dynamic
	platform matching works: x64 and x86
	anycpu not available

winrt, wp (all of them)
	cppinterop_sqlite3_dynamic
	platform matching works: arm and x86
	anycpu not available

nuget targets match any cpu is busted

figure out a way to disable the mac/ios projects while
using msbuild from the command line

for the cppinterop dll build, why does winrt80 generate .exp
and .lib?

Win32 in the sln file

auto-generate the test projects as well?

do we need separate platform assemblies for .NET 4.5 vs 4.5.1 ?

do we need separate platform assemblies for older versions of .NET,
like 4.0 ?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.
auto-generate this.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  

add tests that use actual named sqlite database files, not just
:memory: and temp dbs.

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.
should reference NUnit as a nuget package

special build for desktop Mono?  or does net45 cover that?

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

separate build of iOS version with a bundled SQLite __Internal ?
would need to build sqlite3 for iOS so we can embed it in the resource
for __Internal.  MonoDevelop Makefile integration?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

question about whether we are statically linking the C library
or not, for the mixed mode assembly.

for the windows pinvoke projects, we need to be building sqlite3 native dlls

Xamarin.Android, pinvoke my_sqlite3, with sqlite3 lib in resource

i hate the way all the tests show up in visual studio, 5 tests with
the same name, no way to distinguish between the platform versions
of each test.

fix those weird compiler warnings on iOS and Android ?

sqlcipher?

note that SQLitePCL.Ugly only builds with the "new" reflection APIs.

looks like profile 259 is the new 78

hmmm.  note that one axis of configuration we are not varying is
the compile options for sqlite itself.  we always build with FTS
and with ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA, and nothing else

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

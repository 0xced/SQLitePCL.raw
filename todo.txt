investigate GC.AddMemoryPressure()

might want bind_blob to allow specifying something
other than transient.  current implementation makes
a copy of the blob every time.

in the raw layer, how to distinguish things that
return a string vs things that return a utf8
byte span?  C# doesn't do overloads on return type.

lots of places in the sqlite API give a pointer to
a zero-terminated string, which would require a
strlen-ish thing to convert to a span.  how many
of these should just return ReadOnlySpan<byte> ?

should we wrap/alias ReadOnlySpan<byte> to something
like utf8string ?  is that what the new Utf8String
type is?

investigate new utf8 things in System.Memory pkg

multi-target to avoid dep on System.Memory for netcore2.1+ ?

need some tests for sqlite-ish case insensitivity of
collation names

--

revisit passing 'object' as user data round trip
through a callback

--

instead of just IGetFunctionPointer, should
we have IResolveLibrary?  how should we wrap the
Load part of NativeLibrary?  or maybe the resulting
IGetFunctionPointer is all that matters, since that's
all provider.dynamic needs?

but who owns the dll handle, and therefore has the
obligation to free it?

figure out SQLitePCLRaw.resolver.whatever.
it's platform-specific.  except for dotnet core 3,
which has NativeLibrary, which we can wrap.

name.  resolver?  resolver.dotnetcore3?

explore bundle native code in embedded resource,
extract to known location and use provider dynamic.
would allow builds to be done entirely without
xamarin sdks.  but the location to write the dll
would need to be injected from platform code?

to be even more ridiculous, we could bundle the
native code in C# as a binary array.  :-)  at
least then we would eliminate all involvement
from msbuild.

problem with embed is that it won't work for all
platforms, still prefer runtimes folder for .net core.  
which means we need two copies?  

use embed for ios and android, like now?  but
for ios, better than static.  and both avoid the
need for platform-specific build sdk stuff?

or maybe just emulate the runtimes folder on all
platforms?  ios and android included?

hmph.  xam android says normal content item is
not supported.  and xam ios also.

but does plain embedded resource work on both
android and ios?

might need to go back to separating the nuget
packages for e_sqlite3 and e_sqlcipher by
platform?  still don't need v120 and v110 and
so on.  but maybe windows, mac, linux separate
again.  but ms ships libuv with all platforms
in one package...

resolver should probably check File.Exists
(on things that are an absolute path) before trying
LoadLibrary/dlopen.

zetetic dynamic needs to look in dirs named x86/x64, 
not rids.  for compat with their existing package.
chg Setup.Load() to check the x86 and x64 dirs?
or create a special Load call for that case?

--

gen_nuspec should write the same EOL convention
on all platforms.  using XmlWriterSettings. NewLineChars
doesn't seem to do what it should.  actually, that
seems fine.  now the problem is the slash-vs-backslash
issue in the nuspec paths.

whether in embedded resource or just a content
file, test using the dylib for ios.  or perhaps not.

review EntryPoint attribute

fix build script to do clean

NuspecProperties doesn't work for PackageTags
because of the semicolon inside it.  how to escape
that?

need to fix up name of sqlcipher lib for android.
needs e_ prefix.

use new t4 local cli tool package
    PlatformNotSupportedException
    logged, mono/t4 #42, fix pending

need push script.  reads the xml file to get
the version

.editorconfig

dotnet-format.  but won't work for provider.tt.

should the other batteries also build on a placeholder
instead of the actual ios lib assembly?  allows
dotnet cli instead of desktop msbuild.

restore those win32 set directory calls somewhere.
but we don't want ifdef down in raw or provider.
maybe in batteries?

want a way to force the tests at the end of
build.bat to use the nupkgs just built, not the
ones in the nuget cache.  previous workaround
was to force a timestamp into the pkg name, but
that's sad.

finish impl of batteries for the net461 case,
like the previous preload from arch dir.

with an SDK-style net461 project, how to control
the cpu target of the build?  msbuild prop Platform?

net461 or net472 ?

I wonder if there are any other ways that v2 breaks 
the existing zetetic package.

investigate console UWP apps with C# for testing.
build 17134.

nuspec should show SQLitePCLRaw org account as
owner?

what should the nuspecs say for min client version?
nuspecs generated by dotnet pack do not have this,
but this was apparently a bug that has been fixed.

DONE: consider default enable_next_stmt() to false

chg release notes in nuspec to reference a URL?
on github?  on my blog?

why is the device xunit runner for UWP crashing?

msbuild props to omit native builds in targets?

concern about dictionary<intptr, T> because it's
a value type?  ios AOT.  ToString() instead?
it would seem that the latest versions of mono
now support this case.

DONE: maybe v2 should use the v141 builds and include arm64

test on uwp, ios, android, net461, mono

nuspec tags.  write them into Directory.Build.props from
gen_nuspecs?

utf8 stuff?  #202
appears to require netcore or net472.  not netstandard.

consider build the tests as an assembly instead of always
compiling the file

--

since we're introducing the e_sqlcipher name,
should we add 3 or 4 to distinguish the
underlying sqlcipher version?

the top half of the provider class is the
same for dynamic vs dllimport.  use a partial
class and share it?

new sn key for lib.e_sqlcipher.  hmmm.
or should we just use the same one as before?
and why do we have the same key for 
the android and ios versions of this?
same goes for e_sqlite3.

--

in general, only one of the following is true:
	win, LoadLibrary, dll suffix
	everything else, dlopen
		macos, dylib suffix
		everything else, so suffix

ios: either system or internal

android: std places
	just load e_sqlite3?

.net core: should find from rid, just
load "e_sqlite3" ?

mono on mac
Xamarin.Mac
mono on linux
.net framework on windows
    subdirs from the targets file

cdecl vs stdcall?

maybe everything which needs a targets file should
also need to pass more info (a path) to Setup

--

add sqlite3_key et al to the pinvoke list?

constructing the string:
	basename
		e_sqlite3
		e_sqlcipher
		sqlite3
		sqlcipher
	add dll/dylib/so suffix
	path
		starting
			cwd
			executingassembly.location
			other?
		subdir
			nothing?
			native/rid (targets)

--

review the weird stuff agg functions do
with the context pointer

later: rename sqlcipher in cb to e_sqlcipher

--

need to setup some x86 stdcall builds for testing?
or just use winsqlite3 itself.  irritating that 
the test suite passes using winsqlite3 and either 
calling convention.  why?

more xunit test cases

goal is to have no ifdefs in core

--

in the readme, explain why iOS lib has static in name.
and why internal.  and why SQLitePCL.lib.embedded.Init()

need the ability to disconnect:
    1.  the env used to compile an assembly
    2.  the lib/env dir in nuget

for bundle_e_sqlite3, we want to build two things for netstandard11:
    1.  e_sqlite3, into netcoreapp
    2.  none, into netstandard11

enable_shared_cache.  is this present?  does akavache need it?

change the targets files
to not do the copy when packages.config is present?

understand runtime.json and rid-specific deps, even
if they are not officially supported

--------

is CopyNuGetImplementations causing trouble?
with project.json : runtimes?

need to go to nuget.org and mark some of the older 
packages deprecated

maybe the "first pinvoke set that works" code should
go somewhere else, higher up?

--------

can we do a dylib ios version?

----

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

should maybe use the value from commit_hook (and rollback_hook) internally
to verify/dispose the hook_handle?

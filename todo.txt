consider creating a new build directory on
every build

bin/release structure under Tests.WP80 is
messed up

WP80 tests claim SetProvider is never called

path in wp80 targets file seems wrong

looks like for bundle_e_sqlite3, the Tests.WP80
project is choosing the portable instead of wp8.

nupkg for wp80 has both wp8 and wp80 dirs?

batteries doesn't work right for wp80 in the test
app project

temporarily removed all netstandard stuff so
the version conflict on xunit.abstractions could
go away

why do the aot runtimes need to be in the
uwp project.json?  and when they are, the dep
on netstandard fails.

why does the ios project.json need runtimes : win ?

project.json is a mess.  maybe switch all the
test runners back to packages.config?  but
that's a different kind of mess.

is CopyNuGetImplementations causing trouble?
with project.json : runtimes?

ios build machine needs sdk 9.3

simulator runs, er, on the mac itself.  :-)

perhaps gen more than one of each test runner
project so we can use different bundles

should MonoAndroid version be 2.3 or 6.0 ?

new docs

why does netstandard.library seem to drag in so much
stuff?  tried building for specific platforms instead
of letting netstandard happen and bring in 50 pkgs.
xunit still goes that way, but if it's only xunit,
that's fine for now.

tests.sln wants to have actual device runners in
it.  generate them?  preconfigure them and unzip?
then fix their project.json/packages.config files
to reference the newly-built nupkgs.  and then
nuget restore from current dir.

gen_nuspec_bundle_ green/e should share more code

for net45, should bundle_green just use provider_sqlite3 
instead of e?  on linux/mac, use system sqlite.  on windows,
use the extension sdk.  but does that exist for net45?

will we ever wish a lib packaged in nuget v3 had a
different name?  should the current stuff have "targets"
in the name?

should all the libs have static/dynamic in the name?
even though the non-ios ones will probably always be
dynamic?

general-purpose gen_nuspec function

combine net45 libs into one pkg?

config_esqlite3 should get reworked, because it only
generates a nuspec, not a csproj

do we need a copy of the main raw assembly compiled specifically
for every tfm?  like android?  or is it sufficient to have
it compiled for each set of compile options, and each platform
use the one that is compatible with it.  problem with netstandard
is that it brings in lots of little deps.

need to go to nuget.org and mark some of the older 
packages deprecated

maybe the "first pinvoke set that works" code should
go somewhere else, higher up?

currently wp8-SL support is limited to e_sqlite3.  no
sqlcipher.  no extension SDK.  although we could in
theory build multiple versions of this, each linked
against a different library name.

build iOS targetted for older iOS versions.  how?

--------

can we do a dylib ios version?

version numbers on SQLitePCL.custom stuff should
not need to match SQLitePCL.raw, and might want to
match the underlying SQLite version number.

maybe a SQLitePCL.custom.sqlite3.nupkg which does
nothing but have platform-specific dependencies
on the others?

does the native code stuff in nuget 3.x get this
specific?  can we provide a package which just looks
at the environment and then has a dependency on
The Right One?

xamarin.mac shouldn't even need to be built on the Mac.
just use a compatible build of SQLitePCL.raw.dll

clean out the rest of this file

Do the collation hook fix thing for config_log

consider whether maybe the sqlite3 intptr dispose should check
the version number and call sqlite3_close_v2 when it's supposedly
available.

switch my env keywords to be the same as the ones nuget uses?

add visual studio 2013 c++ runtime sdkreference.  but injecting an
SDKReference in the .targets file sort of doesn't work, and using
a powershell tool is so inelegant.  MESSAGE.

annoying that an injected reference doesn't show up in the
References list in visual studio

error if configuration is not release or debug
but configuration in xamarin.ios is actually stuff like iPhone, etc

why does the sqlitepcl ios platform assembly show
no assembly info when viewed in xamarin studio?

Win32 in the sln file

auto-generate the test projects as well?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.
auto-generate this.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.
should reference NUnit as a nuget package

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

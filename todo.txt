should main nupkg have a wp8-only dep on
native.v120_wp80 ?  argument against this is that
the dep is in bundle_green, and without the dep,
somebody could replace esqlite3.

currently wp8-SL support is limited to esqlite3.  no
sqlcipher.  no extension SDK.

changes to eliminate code in bundle_green and let the main assembly
have multiple pinvokes in it.

win81 failing validation.  C++ compile settings changed since
0.8.6?  Windows App Certification Kit.  is it scanning for
pinvokes?

build iOS targetted for older iOS versions

LoadLibraryEx

--------

use reflection to find all classes that implement ISQLiteProvider?
would this catch the _internal case for ios?

can we do a dylib ios version?

is there any case where we would need the Batteries.Init()
function?  like for an ios problem?

keep Batteries.Init() somewhere, so SQLite-net won't break?

version numbers on SQLitePCL.custom stuff should
not need to match SQLitePCL.raw, and might want to
match the underlying SQLite version number.

maybe a SQLitePCL.custom.sqlite3.nupkg which does
nothing but have platform-specific dependencies
on the others?

need the sqlcipher builds for windows-ish things

and an ios one that uses common crypto

need custom sqlite3 packages in nuget 3.x style

does the native code stuff in nuget 3.x get this
specific?  can we provide a package which just looks
at the environment and then has a dependency on
The Right One?

xamarin.mac shouldn't even need to be built on the Mac.
just use a compatible build of SQLitePCL.raw.dll

do we need two sets of sqlite3 projects?  one set for
e, and the other set for the SL cppinterop stuff?

cppinterop is only for SL-flavored WP8.  it does not
support e.  or it only supports e.

all the custom sqlite builds need to end up called
esqlite3.  except maybe the ones for SL-flavored WP8?

need a dylib build for ios

need e nuget packages

clean out the rest of this file

Do the collation hook fix thing for config_log

consider whether maybe the sqlite3 intptr dispose should check
the version number and call sqlite3_close_v2 when it's supposedly
available.

switch to xUnit?

switch my env keywords to be the same as the ones nuget uses?

test_cases.cs nuget, nunit vs mstest

add visual studio 2013 c++ runtime sdkreference.  but injecting an
SDKReference in the .targets file sort of doesn't work, and using
a powershell tool is so inelegant.  MESSAGE.

annoying that an injected reference doesn't show up in the
References list in visual studio

error if configuration is not release or debug
but configuration in xamarin.ios is actually stuff like iPhone, etc

why does the sqlitepcl ios platform assembly show
no assembly info when viewed in xamarin studio?

Win32 in the sln file

auto-generate the test projects as well?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.
auto-generate this.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.
should reference NUnit as a nuget package

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

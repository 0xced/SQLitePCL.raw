it would be nice to prevent Ext.Net45.cppinterop from loading
in Xamarin since it depends on SQLitePCL.cppinterop.Net45, which
is incompatible.

add tests that use actual named sqlite database files, not just
:memory: and temp dbs.

update/fix the nuget stuff

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.

in the csproj files, consider use of Choose/When to have conditional 
references and such.  or conditional profile 78/158/etc.

special build for desktop Mono?  or does net45 cover that?

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

separate build of iOS version with a bundled SQLite __Internal ?
would need to build sqlite3 for iOS so we can embed it in the resource
for __Internal.  MonoDevelop Makefile integration?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

need separate test projects for each platform assembly, including
both pinvoke and cppinterop?

question about whether we are statically linking the C library
or not, for the mixed mode assembly.

building static lib for sqlite3 when what we really need is the
dll, for winrt/pinvoke and for desktop/pinvoke anyway.

remove the VS gallery sqlite references

Xamarin.Android, pinvoke my_sqlite3, with sqlite3 lib in resource

i hate the way all the tests show up in visual studio, 5 tests with
the same name, no way to distinguish between the platform versions
of each test.

if we marked the iOS platform assembly with something that
forced the linker to include it no matter what, would the platform
resolver reflection code find it?

fix those weird compiler warnings on iOS and Android ?

sqlcipher?

note that SQLitePCL.Ugly only builds with the "new" reflection APIs.

document cases where we have code that is shared by different platform
assemblies

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.

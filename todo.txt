gen_nuspec_bundle_ green/e should share more code

will we ever wish a lib packaged in nuget v3 had a
different name?  should the current stuff have "targets"
in the name?

should all the libs have static/dynamic in the name?
even though the non-ios ones will probably always be
dynamic?

general-purpose gen_nuspec function

combine net45 libs into one pkg?

config_esqlite3 should get reworked, because it only
generates a nuspec, not a csproj

fix all the native libs to have e_ underscore

do we need a copy of the main raw assembly compiled specifically
for every tfm?  like android?  or is it sufficient to have
it compiled for each set of compile options, and each platform
use the one that is compatible with it.

need to go to nuget.org and mark some of the older 
packages deprecated

xamarin_sqlite3 ?

winsqlite3 ?

maybe the "first pinvoke set that works" code should
go somewhere else, higher up?

currently wp8-SL support is limited to e_sqlite3.  no
sqlcipher.  no extension SDK.  although we could in
theory build multiple versions of this, each linked
against a different library name.

build iOS targetted for older iOS versions

LoadLibraryEx

--------

can we do a dylib ios version?

version numbers on SQLitePCL.custom stuff should
not need to match SQLitePCL.raw, and might want to
match the underlying SQLite version number.

maybe a SQLitePCL.custom.sqlite3.nupkg which does
nothing but have platform-specific dependencies
on the others?

need the sqlcipher builds for windows-ish things

and an ios one that uses common crypto

need custom sqlite3 packages in nuget 3.x style

does the native code stuff in nuget 3.x get this
specific?  can we provide a package which just looks
at the environment and then has a dependency on
The Right One?

xamarin.mac shouldn't even need to be built on the Mac.
just use a compatible build of SQLitePCL.raw.dll

do we need two sets of sqlite3 projects?  one set for
e, and the other set for the SL cppinterop stuff?

cppinterop is only for SL-flavored WP8.  it does not
support e.  or it only supports e.

all the custom sqlite builds need to end up called
esqlite3.  except maybe the ones for SL-flavored WP8?

need a dylib build for ios

need e nuget packages

----

clean out the rest of this file

----

Do the collation hook fix thing for config_log

consider whether maybe the sqlite3 intptr dispose should check
the version number and call sqlite3_close_v2 when it's supposedly
available.

switch to xUnit?

switch my env keywords to be the same as the ones nuget uses?

test_cases.cs nuget, nunit vs mstest

add visual studio 2013 c++ runtime sdkreference.  but injecting an
SDKReference in the .targets file sort of doesn't work, and using
a powershell tool is so inelegant.  MESSAGE.

annoying that an injected reference doesn't show up in the
References list in visual studio

error if configuration is not release or debug
but configuration in xamarin.ios is actually stuff like iPhone, etc

why does the sqlitepcl ios platform assembly show
no assembly info when viewed in xamarin studio?

Win32 in the sln file

auto-generate the test projects as well?

docs: need a complete list, in tabular form, of the platform
assemblies and an explanation of the use cases for each one.
auto-generate this.

need at least one test project for each platform assembly.  

add an NUnit project on Windows/Net45, so that build breakage
with NUnit can be detected when making changes on windows.
should reference NUnit as a nuget package

sqlite3.Mac?  or use platform-installed sqlite on MacOS?

docs on all the methods in raw, especially where the params
differ from the C API

----------------

sqlite API issues:

should sqlite3_commit_hook() return something?  the C function returns the
user pointer, which has no useful parallel for us to return.  I sort of hate
the fact that it returns void, since we can't check errors on it.  but
the underlying C function doesn't really return any useful info for error
checking either.
